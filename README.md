# TargetScan

Unofficial fork of [TargetScan](http://www.targetscan.org/).

You're free to use TargetScan data or code for your research and display TargetScan output in your presentations or papers, as long as you cite at least one TargetScan reference, preferably the most appropriate one based on the type of TargetScan data you used. These references are listed on the home page of each dataset of each release. The basic seed-based algorithm used by TargetScan is from [Lewis et al., 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.12.035). The use of context scores is from [Grimson et al., 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2007.06.017), and the use of preferential conservation (branch length and PCT) is from [Friedman et al., 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.082701.108). TargetScanWorm is from [Jan et al., 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09616), and TargetScanFly is from [Ruby et al., 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.6597907). In TargetScanHuman 7, centered sites are from [Shin et al., 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2010.06.005), 3' UTR profiles are from [Nam et al., 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.02.013), and cumulative weighted context++ scores are from [Agarwal et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005).
